## Video Demo

In this video demonstration, I will showcase the functionalities of the Health and Fitness Club Management System. The video will cover the following aspects:

- Explanation of ER Model: I'll provide a quick overview of the Entity-Relationship (ER) model used in my application, highlighting key entities, attributes, and relationships.

- Mapping ER Model to Schema: I'll demonstrate how I mapped the ER model to the database schema, showing how entities and relationships were translated into tables and constraints.

- DDL and DML Files: I'll navigate through the project folder to showcase the Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) files. While not delving into details.

- Functionality Walkthrough: I'll walk through each functionality as outlined in the project requirements.

- Code Structure Overview: Lastly, I'll provide a brief overview of the code structure.
